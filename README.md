  This project focuses on enhancing the structure and maintainability of HTML and CSS code through the application of semantic selectors and comprehensive comments. By utilizing semantic selectors, we aim to improve the readability and accessibility of the HTML code. Additionally, thorough commenting in the CSS file will provide insights into the purpose and functionality of each style rule, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the styling.
